# ArduinoKit
Arduino Plugin for Unreal Engine.

>This code is copied from https://bitbucket.org/danielvmacedo/arduinokitue4/src/master/. All Credits to him.

Because this plugin was not working with the newest Version I've updated the code to work with the newest unrealengine version (4.25).

## How to use it
Download the code and copy the ArduinoKit folder into the Plugins folder inside your UnrealEngine Project. (You may have to create the folder first).

### Step by Step

1. Create a new Project (If you dont have already)
2. Close it if it's open
3. Open the folder of the Project and create a Plugins folder in it (If you dont have already)
4. Download this Repository
5. Copy the ArduinoKit folder into your newly created Plugins folder
6. Restart the unrealengine editor
7. Open the plugins menu from (edit/plugins) and click ArduinoKit
8. Activate it from there (you might need to restart once again)
9. Use it
